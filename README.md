## How To Play

As this is a clicking game, you play by... clicking! To gain a point all you have to do is click a Spongebob character. Remember who you click though, as you may only click each character once or you'll lose. You have 5 seconds for each click.

Every 12 points you gain, all of the characters will reset meaning that you can click them all again!
